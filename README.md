A complete bus booking system using laravel 8 framework and php. 

below is the link to an example sql dump file for the sake of testing

An ideal test case would be creating a new user, creating trip/cities as much as wanted, toggling the admin privlege then acting as a customer. book the trip you'd like and have it checked on my trips. 

the default home page for a customer is: http://127.0.0.1:8000/  
the default home page for an admin is: http://127.0.0.1:8000/dashboard  

as an admin you can access both customer end and the backend (admin)    




The task was quite challenging and I believe I made decent progress with what I reached below are some possible bugs that am aware of but didn't have the time to compelete.
Thank you for giving me the chance to try and upload to github again

*Creating trips the from/to Cities are not dynamic unforunately  <br/>
*the seats are not deducted in the right amount when 2 or more tickets are booked  
*middlewares of admins can access customer's side  
*trip capacity won't deduct of same line busses  


Looking forward to learn from your expert team if I get the chance to hopefully work with them  

Best regards!
