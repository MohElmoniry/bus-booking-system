An ideal test case would be creating a new user, creating trip/cities as much as wanted, toggling the admin privlege then acting as a customer. book the trip you'd like and have it checked on my trips.

the default home page for a customer is: sample.test
the default home page for an admin is: sample.test/dashboard

as an admin you can access both customer end and the backend (admin)
