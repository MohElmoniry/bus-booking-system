Greetings! 

The task was quite challenging and I believe I made decent progress with what I reached below are some possible bugs that am aware of but didn't have the time to compelete.
Thank you for giving me the chance to try and upload to github again

*Creating trips the from/to Cities are not dynamic unforunately
*the seats are not deducted in the right amount when 2 or more tickets are booked 
*middlewares of admins can access customer's side
*visual bug of the dragdown button in the frontend
*trip capacity won't deduct of same line busses 


Looking forward to learn from your expert team if I get the chance to hopefully work with them

Best regards!
